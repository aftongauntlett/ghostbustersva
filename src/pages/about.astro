      <p>
        Ghostbusters, Virginia (GBVA) was <strong class="glow">established in 2001</strong> by a lifelong
        Ghosthead and rather young member of the Ghostbusters community. Since then GBVA has (like many
        things) ebbed and flowed with popularity and activity, culminating in 2011 with a spike in popularity
        that has established GBVA as
        <strong class="glow">the premier Ghostbusters franchise</strong> in the grand Commonwealth of
        Virginia.
      </p>

      <p>
        GBVA is unique, in that unlike other states where multiple groups manifest themselves in
        different pockets of fandom, we act as
        <strong class="glow">a large umbrella for all Ghostbusters fans in Virginia</strong>.
        Individual groups can maintain their group identity while proudly flying the GBVA banner and
        participating in GBVA events like conventions, fundraisers, build parties, and more. The
        three primary GBVA groups are
        <strong class="glow">The Richmond Division</strong>, serving the greater Richmond metro
        area, <strong class="glow">District 757</strong> protecting Southeastern Virginia from all manner
        of spooks, specters, and ghosts, and
        <strong class="glow">the NOVA Division</strong> keeping the northern border of Virginia safe and
        sound.
      </p>
      <hr class="divider" />
      <p>
        These groups are unique in their own way, but under the GBVA banner they are able to pool
        their resources and together be a stronger franchise and participate with unparalleled
        cooperation at GBVA events.
        <strong class="glow">We are stronger together than we are separate.</strong> These three groups,
        along with members from all over Virginia (including the Eastern Shore), are what make GBVA such
        a fantastic franchise and lend us a strong future filled with
        <strong class="glow">good fun, memories, and lifelong friendships</strong>.

        Every April, Ghostbusters Virginia calls on franchises across the globe to join
        <strong class="glow">Proton Pets</strong> — a month-long, community-driven fundraiser supporting
        local pet shelters and pet pantries. It's a chance for Ghostbusters everywhere to come together
        and make a real difference for our furry friends.
      </p>
      <hr class="divider" />
      <p>
        We're proud to see fellow franchises like the
        <strong class="glow">Louisiana Ghost Busters</strong> joining the effort and supporting pets in
        their communities. Proton Pets is an open call to action for Ghostbusters groups around the world
        to help local pets in need.
