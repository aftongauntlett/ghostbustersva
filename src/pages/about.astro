    <h1>About Ghostbusters Virginia</h1>
    <p>
      Ghostbusters, Virginia (GBVA) was established in 2001 by a lifelong Ghosthead and rather young
      member of the Ghostbusters community. Since then GBVA has (like many things) ebbed and flowed
      with popularity and activity, culminating in 2011 with a spike in popularity that has
      established GBVA as the premier Ghostbusters franchise in the grand Commonwealth of Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      GBVA is unique, in that unlike other states where multiple groups manifest themselves in
      different pockets of fandom, we act as a large umbrella for all Ghostbusters fans in Virginia.
      Individual groups can maintain their group identity while proudly flying the GBVA banner and
      participating in GBVA events like conventions, fundraisers, build parties, and more. The three
      primary GBVA groups are The Richmond Division, serving the greater Richmond metro area,
      District 757 protecting Southeastern Virginia from all manner of spooks, specters, and ghosts,
      and the NOVA Division keeping the northern border of Virginia safe and sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      These groups are unique in their own way, but under the GBVA banner they are able to pool
      their resources and together be a stronger franchise and participate with unparalleled
      cooperation at GBVA events. We are stronger together than we are separate. These three groups,
      along with members from all over Virginia (including the Eastern Shore), are what make GBVA
      such a fantastic franchise and lend us a strong future filled with good fun, memories, and
      lifelong friendships.
